# kmm-movieapp
This app demonstrate that how Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile SDK can be used to develop cross platform mobile app that works on both Android and iOS platforms.

# About 
Kotlin Multiplatform SDK allows to write cross platform mobile app that runs on Android and iOS platforms. This movie app
app is using the common shared module to use business logic. Here, network layer is implemented as a shared module and will be used as follow in Android and iOS projects. 
KMM is trusted in production by many of the worldâ€™s leading companies, including Philips, Netflix, Leroy Merlin, and VMWare.

## 1. Android App
Android app is build just like another native Android app where the app app module is using the shared module created by KMM project. It will get data from the MovieSDK class that is present in shared module.
- UI - Android UI is designed by using Jetpack Compose.
- Business Logic - Using business logic implemented in shared module.

## 2. iOS App
An iOS app is using the shared module as a regular framework to use business logic.
- UI - iOS app UI is designed by using SwiftUI.
- Business logic - Using business logic implemented in shared module.

## 3. Shared Module
The common module being used by both Android and iOS applications. We have implemented network layer in this module which is calling TMDB movie API to get movie data.
The consumer of this module can interact via exposed public API. [MovieSDK](https://github.com/Sushant-Hande/kmm-movieapp/blob/main/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/sushanthande/movieapp/MovieSDK.kt) class is an entry point for this module that consumer app will use.
